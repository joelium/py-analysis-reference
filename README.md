# Python Cheat Sheets for Data Analysis

## What this project is
This project is a seires of Python library cheat sheets specifically for data analysis.It uses the python libraries [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html). Other libraries will be added at a later date such as [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html). Each reference guide willl note the libraries and example data sources used at the start. I strongly recommend you familiarise yourself with the documentation for these libraries, as it will be able to give you a lot more detail on various functions than I will be supplying here.

## What is project isn't
The project isn't designed to teach you the tools, but is intended to be a reference to help you when learning or undertaking different projects.

## Prerequisites
Although the project has been assembled using the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html), you can use any python environment. The project is based on Python 3, a lot of the code and syntax won't work with Python 2.

In writing these guides I presume you already have a basic understanding of python syntax, variables, formatting, and functions. If you aren't familiar with any of these, I recommend as a minimum you take the [free python course on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python). Kaggle is a great source for free and open datasets you can use and learn with. You can supplement this additional learning such as this free lesson [Introduction To Python Programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/pythonforbeginnersintro/) on Udemy. For some practical ways you can use python while learning, take a look at [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/). The author has made the whole book available on their website for free, but you can purchase different formats if you prefer

## Learning data analysis
I've learnt the majority of my data analyisi skills through dataquest.io. [This link](app.dataquest.io/referral-signup/xux17eu9/) to them is a referral link, I'll get free access if 4 people sign up using the link, nothing else. [This](dataquest.io) is the normal link to their site if you prefer. This guide is not linked to them in any way, it's just the method of learning I've found is best for me so far.
